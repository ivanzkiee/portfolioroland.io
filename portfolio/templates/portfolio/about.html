                <h2>Hello, I'm Roland Ivan M. Palasigue</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a dedicated Computer Science student at STI College Munoz-EDSA, Quezon City, 
                    with a strong passion for web development, software engineering, and technology 
                    innovation. Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I am 
                    actively seeking On-the-Job Training opportunities where I can apply my 
                    knowledge, enhance my programming and problem-solving skills, and gain 
                    hands-on experience in a professional IT environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey in technology began with my IT studies in Mobile Application and Web 
                    Development (2020-2022), where I built a solid foundation in programming 
                    languages and web technologies. This foundation led me to develop TenantFlow, 
                    my 3rd-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science thesis project—a comprehensive 
                    web-based rental system that demonstrates my full-stack development capabilities 
                    using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django. Through this thesis project, I gained 
                    extensive experience in frontend design, backend logic implementation, testing, 
                    and system documentation, showcasing my ability to deliver a complete, 
                    production-ready application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My technical expertise spans multiple programming languages including Java, 
                    Android development, C#, SQL, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                    Django). I'm also proficient in productivity tools like Microsoft Office 365 
                    and Google Workspace, and have experience in network troubleshooting and 
                    hardware/software maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond technical skills, I've completed over 16 certifications and training 
                    programs covering diverse areas such as cybersecurity, data science, AI for 
                    business, leadership, and digital citizenship. These certifications from 
                    reputable organizations like DICT, HP Foundation, Oracle Academy, and Cisco 
                    Networking Academy reflect my commitment to continuous learning and professional 
                    development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leadership and collaboration are integral parts of who I am. I've been actively 
                    involved in the Central Student Government (CSG) at STI College Munoz-EDSA, 
                    progressing from Computer Science Representative (2022-2023) to Secretary 
                    (2023-2024), and currently serving as Vice President - External and Technical 
                    Committee Head (2025-Present). In these roles, I've coordinated technical 
                    requirements for campus-wide programs, managed documentation, and successfully 
                    organized events with 300+ student participants, demonstrating my ability to 
                    lead teams and execute complex projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My soft skills include effective leadership, time management, teamwork, and 
                    adaptability—qualities that I've developed and refined through both academic 
                    and extracurricular experiences. I believe in the power of collaboration and 
                    continuous improvement, always seeking opportunities to learn from others and 
                    contribute to meaningful projects.
